OpenCV is released under a BSD license and hence it’s free for both academic and commercial use. It has C++, C, Python and Java interfaces and supports Windows, Linux, Mac OS, iOS and Android. OpenCV was designed for computational efficiency and with a strong focus on real-time applications. Written in optimized C/C++, the library can take advantage of multi-core processing. Enabled with OpenCL, it can take advantage of the hardware acceleration of the underlying heterogeneous compute platform. Adopted all around the world, OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 9 million. Usage ranges from interactive art, to mines inspection, stitching maps on the web or through advanced robotics.

OpenCV(Open Source Computer Vision Library)是一個集合數百種演算法的跨平台電腦視覺庫。只要是針對影像做辨識、操作、分析等，不管是要做人臉辨識、物件辨識、車牌辨識、人形偵測、物件追蹤、影像壓縮、影像加密等各種影像處理，OpenCV確實是一個很好的輔助工具，目前已經可以在Windows、Linux、iOS及Android平台上使用，支援的程式語言有C/C++、Java、Python、Matlab、Ruby及C#等，已經是大部分影像處理使用者必備的涵式庫了，以下會介紹OpenCV的主要功能、使用方式及範例程式碼。
